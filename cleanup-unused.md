# What is the Cleanup Process

The `Cleanup operation` (also known as `Cleanup unused`) is the process by which the plugin collects the [**unused**](index#what-is-consider-unused) from the input assets and creates a [Cleanup report](#what-is-the-cleanup-report).

## What is fast cleanup

Relys on cached information to perform a cleanup operations

## What is a complex cleanup

Loads every asset in memory to get up to date references for all assets. 

Note/Warning: Currently disable due to engine crashes.
